### Data-Exchange

install the dependencies by running 
`yarn`

Next, start the dev server by running `yarn dev`

You will need to run the data-exchange-backend server

The home page shows which exchanges are active and inactive

The books page allows for multiple selection of exchanges and a pair that is shared between all of them.

Improvements:
1. Add BigNumber.js is probably one of the most important
2. Unit test the front end
3. Add Styling
4. Show arbitrage opportunities per exchange
