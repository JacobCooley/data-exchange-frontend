### Data-Exchange

install the dependencies by running 
`yarn`

Next, start the dev server by running `yarn dev`

The home page shows which exchanges are active and inactive

The books page allows for multiple selection of exchanges and a pair that is shared between all of them.

Improvements:
1. Add BigNumber.js is probably one of the most important
2. Make chart data aggregate to better resemble depth chart
3. Unit test the front end
4. Add Styling
5. Show arbitrage opportunities per exchange
