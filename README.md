## Notes

You will need to run the data-exchange-backend server

The home page shows which exchanges are active and inactive

The books page allows for multiple selection of exchanges and a pair that is shared between all of them.

Improvements:
1. Add BigNumber.js is probably one of the most important as it will also fix the scentific notation issues
2. Unit test the front end
3. Add Styling
4. Show arbitrage opportunities per exchange
5. Match each chart to the same scale + zoom in/out
